# Codeforces

My solutions to problems from the Codeforces platform.
Since I solved about 400 problems on Codeforces I uploaded here only solutions to these tasks with a difficulty rating of at least 2000. The rest of my solutions are available on my [Codeforces profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/Itnes)

The problems included here cover a variety of more advanced algorithms, data structures, and techniques. Some of them are:
-Li Chao Tree
-Meet in the middle
-Divide & Conquer Dp Optimization
-2-Sat
-Euler Totient Function
-Flows
-Bridges & Articulation Points
-Persistent Segment Tree
-Heavy Light Decomposition
-Centroid Decomposition

Also, many better-known algorithms such as:
-Hashing
-Segment Trees
-Lowest Common Ancestor
-DFS & BFS
-Binary Search
-Dynamic Programming
-Extended Euclides
